# WoW Addon Development Chatmode Setup - Complete

## ✅ Files Created

### 1. Global Chatmode File
**Location**: `<VS-Code-User-Folder>\prompts\wow-addon-development.chatmode.md`  
*Note: User folder is typically: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User`*

**Purpose**: 
- Available across ALL VS Code projects

- ✅ Self-improvement protocol with "Discovered Patterns" section
- ✅ "Lessons Learned" section for error correction
- ✅ Complete WoW API quick reference
- ✅ Common patterns and best practices
- ✅ Performance optimization guidelines

### 2. Project-Specific Instructions File
**Location**: `<Repo-Path>\.github\instructions\wow-addon-development.instructions.md`

**Purpose**:
- AscensionVanity project-specific patterns
- Applies only to this repository
- Complements the main copilot-instructions.md
- Targets: `**/*.{lua,toc,xml,ps1,md}`

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Project file structure and load order rules
- ✅ Database structure documentation
- ✅ Consolidation philosophy enforcement
- ✅ Project-specific gotchas tracking
- ✅ Quick decision guide for common questions
- ✅ Common tasks reference guide

## 🎯 How They Work Together

### Priority Order
1. **User request** (highest priority)
2. **Project-specific instructions** (this file)
3. **Main copilot-instructions.md** (project context)
4. **Global chatmode** (general WoW knowledge)

### When Each is Used

#### Global Chatmode
- **Activated**: When you use the chatmode in VS Code
- **Applies to**: Any WoW addon project
- **Best for**: General WoW API questions, Lua patterns, new projects

#### Project Instructions
- **Activated**: Automatically when editing files in AscensionVanity
- **Applies to**: Only this repository
- **Best for**: Project-specific patterns, file structure, workflows

## 🔄 Self-Updating Mechanism

Both files include **explicit sections for dynamic updates**:

### In Global Chatmode:
```markdown
## 📖 Discovered Patterns (Self-Learning Section)
### Pattern: [Pattern Name]
**Discovered**: [Date]
**Context**: [Where/when discovered]
**Implementation**: [Code example]
---
*Add new patterns above this line as they are discovered*
```

### In Project Instructions:
```markdown
## 📖 Discovered Project Patterns
### Pattern: [Name]
**Discovered**: [Date]
**Files Affected**: [List]
---
*Add new patterns here as discovered*
```

### How to Update

**As you work with Copilot:**
1. When you discover a useful pattern → Document it in the appropriate section
2. When you encounter an error → Log it in "Lessons Learned"
3. When you find a project-specific gotcha → Add to the gotchas section
4. Periodically review and refine the content

**Copilot will:**
- Reference these files automatically
- Suggest additions when it learns new patterns
- Avoid searching for explicitly excluded topics
- Follow project-specific conventions

## 🚫 Topics Explicitly Excluded

**Both files explicitly tell Copilot NOT to search for:**
- ❌ Azure, AWS, or any cloud services
- ❌ Entra ID, OAuth, identity systems
- ❌ Modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- ❌ .NET Core, ASP.NET
- ❌ Docker, Kubernetes
- ❌ SQL databases
- ❌ Mobile development

**This prevents wasted time searching irrelevant documentation!**

## 🎨 Innovation Features

### Meta-Learning Capability
Both files can **evolve based on usage**:
- Track successful patterns
- Log mistakes and corrections
- Document project-specific discoveries
- Build institutional knowledge over time

### Version Tracking

```

### Decision Guides
Quick flowcharts for common decisions:
- Should I create a new file?
- Should I search for documentation?
- Which file should handle this task?

## 📚 Reference Sections

### Global Chatmode Contains:
- Essential WoW API function reference
- Lua 5.1 limitations and workarounds
- TOC file structure
- Common addon patterns (namespace, events, tooltips)
- Performance optimization techniques
- Problem-solving frameworks

### Project Instructions Contains:
- AscensionVanity file structure
- Load order requirements
- Database structure
- Data processing workflow
- Common tasks with step-by-step instructions
- Project-specific gotchas

## 🚀 Usage Tips

### To Activate Global Chatmode:
1. Open any WoW addon project
2. Start a chat in Copilot
3. Reference the chatmode with: `@wow-addon-development`

### To Benefit from Project Instructions:
- **Automatic**: Just work on files in the AscensionVanity repo
- The `applyTo` pattern targets: `**/*.{lua,toc,xml,ps1,md}`
- Copilot will automatically reference these instructions

### Best Practices:
1. **Review before big changes**: Read relevant sections first
2. **Document discoveries**: Add to the self-learning sections
3. **Keep current**: Update version numbers and dates
4. **Share learnings**: Commit instruction updates to the repo

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**
- ✅ Copilot stops suggesting Azure/Entra solutions
- ✅ WoW API responses are accurate and contextual
- ✅ Project-specific patterns are followed automatically
- ✅ Load order and file structure are respected
- ✅ New patterns are documented as discovered
- ✅ Responses reference the instruction files

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Monthly Review:
- Review "Discovered Patterns" sections
- Consolidate similar patterns
- Update version numbers
- Remove outdated information

### After Major Changes:
- Document new project patterns
- Update file structure if changed
- Add new gotchas discovered
- Increment version number

**Status**: ✅ Setup Complete
**Next Steps**: Start using Copilot with your WoW addon work and watch the files evolve!

The files are now **living documents** that will improve with every conversation and project change.
