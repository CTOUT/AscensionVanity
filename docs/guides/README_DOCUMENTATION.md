## üéØ Quick Reference Guide

### Understanding Coverage

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **96.7% coverage** (2,032 of 2,101 items extracted)
- ‚úÖ **Excellent coverage** of true world drops
- ‚ùå **40 items skipped** (mostly vendor/token/event items)

**What's Included:**
- All standard creature drops with database entries
- Boss drops with proper "Dropped by" tab data
- Items with matching NPC names

**What's Excluded (Intentionally):**
- Vendor purchases (Argent Quartermaster, etc.)
- Token exchange items (High Inquisitor Qormaladon)
- Event-exclusive items (Manastorm event)
- Achievement rewards

**What's Missing (Needs Investigation):**
- 9 items from bosses without database entries
- 10 items with no obvious source (likely unobtainable)
- 1 event item (confirmed unobtainable)

### Using the Documentation

**For End Users:**
- Refer to SKIPPED_ITEMS_ANALYSIS.md to explain coverage
- Mention 96.7% coverage as excellent for version 1.0
- Note that missing items are primarily vendor/special items

**For Developers:**
- Check TODO_FUTURE_INVESTIGATIONS.md before planning updates
- Review ExtractDatabase.ps1 comments to understand validation logic
- Use SkippedItems_Detailed.txt for debugging

**For Community Management:**
- Point users to TODO list for "Items Needing Verification"
- Encourage players to report drops from listed bosses
- Update TODO when community confirms/denies suspected drops

---

### Maintenance Workflow

**When adding new verified items:**

1. ‚úÖ Check TODO_FUTURE_INVESTIGATIONS.md for the item
2. ‚úÖ Confirm drop source in-game or via community
3. ‚úÖ Add to VanityDB.lua manually OR update extraction script
4. ‚úÖ Test in-game with /reload
5. ‚úÖ Update TODO status (move from "NEEDS VERIFICATION" to "Won't Fix" or remove)
6. ‚úÖ Update SKIPPED_ITEMS_ANALYSIS.md if categorization changes
7. ‚úÖ Increment version number in .toc file
8. ‚úÖ Commit with descriptive message

**When re-running extraction after game updates:**

1. ‚úÖ Run `.\ExtractDatabase.ps1 -Force` to bypass cache
2. ‚úÖ Compare new coverage % with previous (should be similar or better)
3. ‚úÖ Check if any "Maybe" items now have database entries
4. ‚úÖ Update documentation if coverage changes significantly
5. ‚úÖ Review SkippedItems_Detailed.txt for new patterns

## üîç Key Insights

### Why 96.7% Coverage is Excellent

**Reality of MMO databases:**
- Not all items are true "drops"
- Some items have incorrect database entries
- Event/vendor items are often miscategorized
- Boss drops may not appear in "Dropped by" tabs

**What this means:**
- 96.7% captures virtually all obtainable world drops
- Missing items are edge cases (bosses, vendors, events)
- Further improvement requires manual verification
- Community feedback is key for remaining items

### Validation Logic Explained

**The script skips items when:**

1. **NPC name doesn't match creature name**
   - Example: Item is "Pink Elekk" but database says "Millhouse Manastorm"
   - This is CORRECT - it's a vendor item, not a drop

2. **No "Dropped by" tab exists**
   - Example: Event-exclusive items or quest rewards
   - This is CORRECT - they're not world drops

3. **No NPCs match the expected creature**
   - Example: Item is "Chromatic Whelp" but no NPC named that in drop list
   - This MAY need investigation - could be boss drop missing from database

**The validation is working as intended** - it prevents false positives!
