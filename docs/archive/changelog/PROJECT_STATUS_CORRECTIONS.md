# PROJECT_STATUS.md Validation & Corrections

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Type**: Documentation Accuracy Audit  
**Severity**: Critical - Multiple False Claims Removed

---

## üîç Summary

The `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` file contained **significant inaccuracies** about the addon's features and file structure. This document details all errors found and corrections made.

---

## ‚ùå Errors Found & Corrected

### 1. Non-Existent File: VanityData_Locations.lua

**ERROR**: Documentation claimed a file `VanityData_Locations.lua` existed with "NPC location data"

**REALITY**: This file never existed. Only two Lua files exist:
- `Core.lua` (8 KB) - Main addon logic
- `VanityDB.lua` (74 KB) - Item-to-NPC mapping database

**CORRECTION**: Removed from folder structure diagram

---

### 2. False Feature Claims: NPC Location Tracking

**ERRORS REMOVED**:
- ‚úó "NPC location tracking" in project overview
- ‚úó "NPC location data with zone-level details" in addon functionality
- ‚úó "Zone information for drop sources" in user features

**REALITY**: The addon does NOT track NPC locations or zones in any way. It only:
- Maps items to NPC IDs
- Shows vanity drops in NPC tooltips when you hover over them

**CORRECTION**: 
- Removed all location-related claims from "Completed Objectives"
- Added location tracking as a future enhancement (Priority 2)

---

### 3. False UI Feature Claims

**ERRORS REMOVED**:
- ‚úó "In-game slash command `/vanity`" - This command does NOT exist
- ‚úó "Minimap button for quick access" - No minimap button exists
- ‚úó "Item tracking interface with progress bars" - No UI interface exists
- ‚úó "Open interface" functionality - There is no interface to open

**REALITY**: The addon provides:
- Slash commands: `/av` or `/ascensionvanity` (NOT `/vanity`)
- Simple toggle commands (on/off, learned status, colors)
- No GUI interface at all - only tooltip modifications

**CORRECTION**:
- Updated slash command references from `/vanity` to `/av`
- Removed all minimap button claims
- Removed "interface" and "progress bars" claims
- Added these as future enhancements (Priority 1)

---

## ‚úÖ Corrected Documentation

### Actual Folder Structure

```

/av color        # Toggle color coding
/av help         # Show all commands
```
