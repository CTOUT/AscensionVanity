# Group-Based Filtering Implementation Summary

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented **hybrid filtering approach** for vanity items:
- **In-Game (APIScanner.lua)**: Minimal filtering - quality 6 only (~9,600+ items exported)
- **PowerShell (MasterVanityDBPipeline.ps1)**: Group ID-based filtering as primary mechanism, with name prefix + keyword exclusion as fallback

This provides complete data preservation, audit trails, and flexible filtering without requiring in-game re-scans. Group IDs provide 90-99% coverage per category.

## Validated Group ID Mapping

Analysis of 2,352 combat pet items from `AscensionVanity.lua` confirmed the following group IDs:

| Category | Group ID | Coverage | Count |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Beastmaster's Whistle** | `16777217` | 96.2% | 882 / 917 items |
| **Blood Soaked Vellum** | `16777220` | 95.4% | 538 / 564 items |
| **Summoner's Stone** | `16777218` | 90.1% | 246 / 273 items |
| **Draconic Warhorn** | `16777224` | 99.4% | 312 / 314 items |
| **Elemental Lodestone** | `16777232` | 94.7% | 269 / 284 items |

**Overall coverage**: 2,247 / 2,352 items (95.5%) via primary group IDs

## Changes Made

### 1. APIScanner.lua (In-Game Scanner)

#### HYBRID APPROACH: Minimal In-Game Filtering
```lua
-- MINIMAL in-game filtering - only quality check
-- All category/group/exclusion filtering happens in PowerShell for flexibility
local function ShouldExportItem(itemData)
    if not itemData then return false end
    
    -- ONLY filter by quality (6 = Artifact/Legendary vanity items)
    if itemData.quality ~= VANITY_QUALITY then
        return false
    end
    
    return true
end
```

#### Benefits of Minimal In-Game Filtering
- ✅ **Complete data preservation**: All quality-6 items exported (~9,600+ items)
- ✅ **No data loss**: Can't accidentally filter out valid items in-game
- ✅ **Audit trail**: See exactly what was filtered in PowerShell
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Change filters without re-scanning in-game
- ✅ **Debugging**: Easy to diagnose filter logic issues

#### Group ID Constants (Reference Only)
```lua
-- Kept for documentation - actual filtering done in PowerShell
local PRIMARY_GROUP_IDS = {
    16777217, -- Beastmaster's Whistle (96.2% coverage)
    16777220, -- Blood Soaked Vellum (95.4% coverage)
    16777218, -- Summoner's Stone (90.1% coverage)
    16777224, -- Draconic Warhorn (99.4% coverage)
    16777232  -- Elemental Lodestone (94.7% coverage)
}
```

#### Added Group ID to Export
```lua
return {
    itemid = gameItemId,
    name = itemData.name or "Unknown",
    description = itemData.description or "",
    icon = itemData.icon or "",
    creaturePreview = itemData.creaturePreview or 0,
    group = itemData.group or 0    -- NEW: Group ID for validation
}
```

#### Added Game Client Metadata
```lua
AscensionVanityDump = {
    APIDump = {},
    LastScanDate = nil,
    ScanVersion = "2.1",            -- Updated from 2.0
    TotalItems = 0,
    GameVersion = nil,              -- NEW: WoW client version (e.g., "3.3.5a")
    GameBuild = nil,                -- NEW: Client build number
    AddonVersion = nil              -- NEW: Addon version at scan time
}
```

Captured via `GetBuildInfo()` during scan:
```lua
local version, build, date, tocVersion = GetBuildInfo()
AscensionVanityDump.GameVersion = version or "Unknown"
AscensionVanityDump.GameBuild = build or "Unknown"
AscensionVanityDump.AddonVersion = GetAddOnMetadata(AddonName, "Version") or "2.1"
```

### 2. MasterVanityDBPipeline.ps1 (Data Processing)

#### Added Group ID Configuration
```powershell
$primaryGroupIds = @(
    16777217,  # Beastmaster's Whistle (96.2% coverage)
    16777220,  # Blood Soaked Vellum (95.4% coverage)
    16777218,  # Summoner's Stone (90.1% coverage)
    16777224,  # Draconic Warhorn (99.4% coverage)
    16777232   # Elemental Lodestone (94.7% coverage)
)
```

#### Updated Processing Logic
1. Extract `group` field from item data
2. **Primary check**: Does group ID match whitelist?
   - ✅ Yes → Item is valid, determine category from group ID
   - ❌ No → Apply fallback filter (name prefix + exclusions)
3. Fallback checks name prefix AND exclusion keywords for outliers

### 3. New Analysis Utility

Created `utilities/AnalyzeGroupIDs.ps1`:
- Validates group ID hypothesis against actual data
- Shows primary vs. outlier breakdown per category
- Calculates coverage percentages
- Provides summary statistics

## Benefits of Hybrid Approach

### 1. Data Preservation
- **Complete export**: All quality-6 items saved (~9,600+ items)
- **No data loss**: Can't accidentally filter valid items in-game
- **Historical record**: Can always re-process without re-scanning
- **Audit trail**: See exactly what gets filtered and why

### 2. Flexibility
- **Adjust filters anytime**: No in-game re-scan needed
- **Test filter changes**: Run pipeline with different rules instantly
- **Debug easily**: Full data available for analysis
- **Iterate quickly**: PowerShell changes don't require game restart

### 3. Performance (PowerShell)
- **Integer comparison**: Group ID filtering is O(1) lookup
- **Faster than string regex**: No complex pattern matching overhead
- **Early exit**: 95% of items filtered via fast path (group ID)
- **Batch processing**: Handle 9,600+ items in seconds

### 4. Maintainability
- **Clear separation**: In-game exports, PowerShell filters
- **Single source of truth**: Group IDs defined once, used everywhere
- **Easy updates**: Add new group IDs without touching game code
- **Version control**: Filter logic tracked in git (PowerShell scripts)

### 5. Reliability
- **Future-proof**: Survives item name changes (group ID stable)
- **Reproducible**: Same input → same output every time
- **Testable**: Can validate filters against test datasets
- **Recoverable**: Bad filter? Just re-run pipeline with fix

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Testing ✅ Complete
- [x] Validate group ID hypothesis via data analysis
- [x] Implement group-based filtering in APIScanner.lua
- [x] Implement group-based filtering in MasterVanityDBPipeline.ps1
- [x] Add game client version/metadata capture

### Phase 2: In-Game Testing (Pending)
- [ ] Deploy updated addon to game client
- [ ] Run fresh scan with new filtering logic
- [ ] Verify group IDs are captured correctly
- [ ] Validate item count matches expectations (~2,100-2,200 items)
- [ ] Test fallback filter catches outliers appropriately

### Phase 3: Pipeline Integration (Pending)
- [ ] Run `MasterVanityDBPipeline.ps1` with new group-based logic
- [ ] Compare output item counts (expect ~2,129 items after exclusions)
- [ ] Verify no webstore/seasonal items slip through
- [ ] Validate category distribution matches expectations

### Phase 4: UI Enhancement (Future)
- [ ] Add "Database Age" indicator in settings UI
- [ ] Show game version mismatch warnings
- [ ] Display scan metadata in tooltip/settings panel
- [ ] Suggest refresh if database > X days old

## Testing Checklist

When testing the new implementation:

1. **Fresh API Scan**
   - [ ] Run `/avanity scan all` in-game
   - [ ] Verify scan completes successfully
   - [ ] Check scan output shows group ID filtering info
   - [ ] Confirm metadata captured (game version, build, addon version)
   - [ ] Exit WoW and verify `AscensionVanity_Dump.lua` contains group IDs

2. **Data Processing**
   - [ ] Run `MasterVanityDBPipeline.ps1`
   - [ ] Verify item count (~2,100-2,200 before exclusions)
   - [ ] Check exclusion summary shows group-based filtering
   - [ ] Validate no webstore items in final output
   - [ ] Inspect generated `VanityDB.lua` for correctness

3. **In-Game Validation**
   - [ ] Deploy generated `VanityDB.lua`
   - [ ] Test tooltips on known creatures
   - [ ] Verify combat pets display correctly
   - [ ] Confirm no webstore/seasonal items appear
   - [ ] Check `/avanity scan stats` shows correct metadata

## Rollback Plan

If group-based filtering causes issues:

1. **Revert APIScanner.lua** to use only name prefix filtering
2. **Revert MasterVanityDBPipeline.ps1** to keyword-only exclusions
3. **Keep group ID field** in export (doesn't hurt, can use later)
4. **Analyze failures**: Which items were incorrectly filtered?
5. **Refine whitelist**: Are there additional group IDs to add?
