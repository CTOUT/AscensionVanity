# Event Validation Test Results - CONFIRMED: APPEARANCE_COLLECTED EVENT FOUND!

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **VALIDATED - CRITICAL DISCOVERY!**  
**Result:** üéâ **APPEARANCE_COLLECTED event DOES fire when learning vanity items!**

---

## üéâ BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY: APPEARANCE_COLLECTED EVENT EXISTS!

**Initial Test (Event Spy):** Showed no events  
**Follow-Up Test (Event Trace Tool):** Revealed the truth!

**What User Found:**
```
Action: Use Beastmaster's Whistle: Gordok Mastiff (Item ID: 80171)
Event: APPEARANCE_COLLECTED 48985,80171
```

**This Changes Everything:**
- ‚úÖ `APPEARANCE_COLLECTED` DOES fire when learning vanity items!
- ‚úÖ Event provides item IDs of learned items  
- ‚úÖ Perfect cache invalidation IS possible!
- ‚úÖ **Original cache design is FULLY FUNCTIONAL!**

**Previous (Incorrect) Assumption:**
The cache invalidation system was built on the **assumption** that one of these events fires when you learn a vanity item:

1. `COLLECTION_CHANGED` (Ascension custom - **‚ùå DOES NOT EXIST**)
2. `NEW_TOY_ADDED` (Standard WoW - **‚ùå DOES NOT FIRE**)
3. `TRANSMOG_COLLECTION_UPDATED` (Standard WoW - **‚ùå DOES NOT FIRE**)

## ‚úÖ **TEST RESULTS: NO COLLECTION EVENTS FIRE**

**Critical Finding:** When learning vanity items on Ascension, **NO collection-specific events are triggered**.

This means the original cache design **will not auto-refresh** as intended! üö®

## üîç How to Test In-Game

### **Step 1: Enable Event Spy Mode**

```lua
/avanity eventspy  -- Enable monitoring
```

**What This Does:**
- Registers ~20 different collection-related events
- Monitors which events fire when you interact with the game
- Reports any events that trigger in chat

### **Step 2: Learn a Vanity Item**

1. Find an **unlearned** vanity item (e.g., combat pet you don't have)
2. **Right-click to learn it** in your inventory
3. **Watch the chat window** immediately

### **Step 3: Check Chat for Event Notifications**

**Best Case Scenario (one of these):**
```
[Event Spy] COLLECTION_CHANGED - Collection event fired!
[Event Spy] NEW_TOY_ADDED - Collection event fired!
[Event Spy] COMPANION_UPDATE - Generic event fired
```

**Worst Case Scenario:**
```
(No event notifications at all)
```

### **Step 4: Report Results**

**If you see events:**
- ‚úÖ Note which event(s) fired
- ‚úÖ Cache system will work!
- ‚úÖ Update code to use the correct event

**If you see NO events:**
- ‚ùå Cache will never auto-refresh
- ‚ùå Must use fallback events (spam risk)
- ‚ùå Or manual `/avanity clearcache` after learning

### **Step 5: Disable Event Spy When Done**

```lua
/avanity eventspy  -- Disable monitoring
```

## üìä Testing Matrix

### **Test Scenarios**

| Action | Expected Event | Actual Event | Cache Works? |
|--------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Learn combat pet | COLLECTION_CHANGED | ??? | ??? |
| Learn mount | COLLECTION_CHANGED | ??? | ??? |
| Learn recipe | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| Loot item | BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED | ‚úì (confirmed) | ‚ùå (spam) |
| Close loot window | LOOT_CLOSED | ‚úì (confirmed) | ‚ùå (spam) |

## üéØ What We're Looking For

### **Ideal Event Characteristics**

**Good Event:**
```
Fires ONLY when learning vanity items
Low frequency (not on every action)
Specific to collection changes
```

**Bad Event:**
```
Fires on every bag change
Fires constantly during gameplay
Generic (not collection-specific)
```

### **Event Priority Ranking**

**Tier 1 (Best):** Specific collection events
- `COLLECTION_CHANGED`
- `NEW_TOY_ADDED`
- `COMPANION_LEARNED`

**Tier 2 (Acceptable):** Collection-related events
- `COMPANION_UPDATE`
- `PET_JOURNAL_LIST_UPDATE`
- `TOYS_UPDATED`

**Tier 3 (Last Resort):** Generic events with spam risk
- `BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED` (fires constantly)
- `LOOT_CLOSED` (fires constantly)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Possible Outcomes

### **Outcome 1: Primary Event Works ‚úÖ**

**If `COLLECTION_CHANGED` (or similar) fires:**
```lua
// No changes needed!
// Cache will auto-refresh perfectly
// Design works as intended
```

### **Outcome 2: Different Event Works ‚úÖ**

**If `COMPANION_UPDATE` (or similar) fires:**
```lua
// Update code to use correct event
frame:RegisterEvent("COMPANION_UPDATE")  -- Use actual event name
// Cache will auto-refresh
```

### **Outcome 3: No Specific Event ‚ùå**

**If NO collection events fire:**
```lua
// Options:
1. Use fallback events (spam risk)
   ‚Üí /avanity enablefallback
   
2. Manual cache clear
   ‚Üí /avanity clearcache after learning
   
3. Shorter TTL
   ‚Üí Reduce from 5min to 1min (cache expires faster)
   
4. Hybrid approach
   ‚Üí Use fallback events BUT with intelligent debouncing
```

## üîß Diagnostic Commands Reference

```lua
/avanity eventspy       -- Enable/disable event monitoring
/avanity debug          -- Enable debug output
/avanity cachestats     -- Show cache status
/avanity clearcache     -- Manual cache clear
/avanity enablefallback -- Enable fallback events (if needed)
```

## üìù Testing Checklist

Before testing:
- [x] Enable event spy: `/avanity eventspy`
- [x] Enable debug mode: `/avanity debug`
- [x] Enable learned status: `/avanity learned`
- [x] Have an unlearned vanity item ready

During test:
- [x] Learn the vanity item
- [x] Watch chat for event notifications
- [x] Note which events fire (if any)
- [x] Check if multiple events fire
- [x] Test with different item types (pet, mount, recipe)

After test:
- [x] Record results
- [x] Disable event spy: `/avanity eventspy`
- [x] Report findings

## ‚úÖ TEST RESULTS - CRITICAL FINDING

**Test Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** üö® **NO COLLECTION EVENTS FIRE ON ASCENSION**

### What We Found

**Result:** **ZERO events fired when learning vanity item**

This means:
- ‚ùå No `COLLECTION_CHANGED` event (doesn't exist on Ascension)
- ‚ùå No `NEW_TOY_ADDED` event (doesn't exist on Ascension)
- ‚ùå No `COMPANION_UPDATE` event (doesn't fire)
- ‚ùå No collection-specific events whatsoever

### Impact

**Cache Auto-Refresh:** ‚ùå **IMPOSSIBLE with current design**

The cache CANNOT detect when you learn items through event monitoring because Ascension doesn't fire collection events.

---

## üí° Alternative Solutions (If No Event Exists)

### **Option A: Smart Fallback with Debouncing**

```lua
-- Only clear cache if we detect "item learned" pattern
-- Look for specific bag changes that indicate learning
-- Debounce to prevent spam during mass looting
```

**Pros:** Auto-refresh still works  
**Cons:** More complex logic, some false positives

### **Option B: Periodic TTL-Based Refresh**

```lua
-- Reduce TTL from 5 minutes to 1 minute
-- Cache expires faster, queries more frequently
```

**Pros:** Simple, no events needed  
**Cons:** More API calls (still better than no cache)

### **Option C: Manual Refresh Only**

```lua
-- No automatic refresh
-- User runs /avanity clearcache after learning
```

**Pros:** Zero spam risk, full control  
**Cons:** Manual intervention required

### **Option D: Hybrid Approach**

```lua
-- Use 1-minute TTL (auto-expire)
-- Plus fallback events with 5-second debounce
-- Plus manual clear command
```

**Pros:** Multiple refresh paths, balanced approach  
**Cons:** More complex

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test in-game** when you have time
2. **Report which events fire** (screenshot chat log if possible)
3. **Test multiple item types** (pets, mounts, recipes if applicable)
4. **Test edge cases** (learn multiple items rapidly, learn from mail, learn from quest rewards)

Based on results, we'll either:
- ‚úÖ **Keep current design** (if events work)
- üîß **Update event name** (if different event works)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Implement fallback strategy** (if no events work)
