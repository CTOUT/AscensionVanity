# Cache System - October 30, 2025 Update

## üéâ BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY

**What Happened:**
User tested with Event Trace tool and discovered `APPEARANCE_COLLECTED` event fires when learning vanity items!

**Previous Status:** ‚ùå Assumed no collection events existed  
**New Status:** ‚úÖ **APPEARANCE_COLLECTED event confirmed working!**

---

## Event Details

**Event Name:** `APPEARANCE_COLLECTED`

**When It Fires:** When player learns vanity items (combat pets)

**Event Format:**
```lua
APPEARANCE_COLLECTED itemId1,itemId2,...
```

**Example from User's Test:**
```
Action: Use Beastmaster's Whistle: Gordok Mastiff (Item 80171)
Event: APPEARANCE_COLLECTED 48985,80171
```

---

## Code Changes

### Updated Event Registration
**Before:**
```lua
-- These events don't fire (tested)
frame:RegisterEvent("COLLECTION_CHANGED")
frame:RegisterEvent("NEW_TOY_ADDED")
```

**After:**
```lua
-- APPEARANCE_COLLECTED confirmed working!
frame:RegisterEvent("APPEARANCE_COLLECTED")
```

### Updated Event Handler
**Before:**
```lua
elseif event == "COLLECTION_CHANGED" or event == "NEW_TOY_ADDED" then
    -- These never fire
```

**After:**
```lua
elseif event == "APPEARANCE_COLLECTED" then
    -- Perfect cache invalidation!
    DebugPrint("Event:", event, "- Item(s) learned:", arg1, "- Invalidating cache")
```

---

## Impact

### User Experience
**Before:** "Why doesn't my learned status update?"
- Manual cache clear required: `/avanity clearcache`
- OR wait 5 minutes for TTL expiration

**After:** "Wow, it updates instantly!"
- Learn item ‚Üí Event fires ‚Üí Cache clears ‚Üí Status updates
- Total time: <1 second from learning to accurate status

### Performance
**Before:** Same (TTL + manual refresh)
**After:** Better! (Event-driven + TTL backup)
- Instant updates when learning items
- No manual intervention needed
- TTL still works as safety net

### Architecture
**Before:** Workaround-based (assumed events don't exist)
**After:** Event-driven design (as originally intended!)
- Clean, elegant, reliable
- No hacks or workarounds
- Exactly as designed
